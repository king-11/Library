<p align="center"> A place to share and read about books. The Website uses user friendly UI by making it really easy to find book of your interest and read about it as well as submit legit new books that people can spend their time with. </p>

<p align="center">I developed this project beacuse I am myself an avid book reader but when i want more books to read either I have to search it on internet or ask my friends around. This project simplifies it , people share books they have read while we provide you with a little bit of insight into that book and then you can go on and read more about it.</p>
